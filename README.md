### How to help
Helping out is very easy once you understand the basics. We have full tutorials available on our website, as well as video tutorials: **[airportediting.com](http://airportediting.com/)**

We highly recommend you join our [Slack team](http://airportediting.slack.com) - it's a great way to meet other editors and get tips and tricks! Email <mailto:contact@airportediting.com> to get started.

It's furthermore highly recommended to check out our [Infinite Flight Airport Editing Beginner's Guide](http://airportediting.com/docs/IFAE_Beginners_Guide.pdf) where you will find information on all challenges of Airport Editing, starting with joining and setting up the software to the actual editing process.

### What to do / not to do

The general rule is "draw what you see", with a few exceptions:

**DO**<br>
* Use accurate imagery for airports.<br>
* Add taxiways.<br>
* Add taxiway lines.<br>
* Add parking spots.<br>
* Modify runways.<br>
* Add airport boundaries.<br>
* Add airport ATC frequencies (please see websites such as airnav.com for this).<br>

**DON'T**<br>
* Add runway markings or text/numbers with taxiway lines (this includes runway numbers, blastpad arrows, etc.).<br>
* Create jet bridges using the taxiway tool.<br>
* Forget to include a boundary.<br>
* Make up an airport - it **HAS** to be a real airport.<br>
* Outline buildings with a taxi line.<br>

### Airport accuracy

In order to achieve maximum accuracy for each airport (in terms of features drawn, location and sizing), the majority of our editors use [SASPlanet](http://www.sasgis.org) (for Windows and Linux only) and [WED-O-Maker](https://wedomaker.wordpress.com). This allows for detailed satellite imagery to be shown on WED. It's free to use, and easy to set up (tutorials are available on the [WED-O-Maker](https://wedomaker.wordpress.com) website).
