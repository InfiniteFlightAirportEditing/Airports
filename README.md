Welcome to Infinite Flight Airport Editing!
===================
Got a passion for design, and want to help improve Infinite Flight? Here, you can help contribute to airport designs, by adding taxiways, taxiway lines, parking spots and more. You'll be helping to pave the future for Infinite Flight airports!

### How to help
Helping out is very easy once you understand the basics. We have full tutorials available on our website, as well as video tutorials:<br>
**[infiniteflightairportediting.github.io](http://infiniteflightairportediting.github.io/)**<br><br>
**Please check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/InfiniteFlightAirportEditing/Airports/issues) before starting your airport. Make sure it isn't already in progress, and if it hasn't been started, please create a new issue with the name of the airport.**

We highly recommend you join our [Slack team](http://airportediting.slack.com) - it's a great way to meet other editors and get tips and tricks! Email <mailto:airports@liveflightapp.com> to get started.

### What to do / not to do

The general rule is "draw what you see", with a few exceptions:

**DO**<br>
* Use accurate imagery for airports.<br>
* Add taxiways.<br>
* Add taxiway lines.<br>
* Add parking spots.<br>
* Modify runways.<br>
* Add airport boundaries.<br>
* Add airport ATC frequencies (please see websites such as airnav.com for this).<br>

**DON'T**<br>
* Add runway markings with taxiway lines (this includes runway numbers, blastpad arrows, etc.).<br>
* Create jet bridges using the taxiway tool.<br>
* Forget to include a boundary.<br>
* Make up an airport - it **HAS** to be a real airport.<br>
* Outline buildings with a taxi line.<br>

### Airport Accuracy

In order to achieve maximum accuracy for each airport (in terms of features drawn, location and sizing), the majority of our editors use [Wedbing](https://wedbing.wordpress.com). This allows for detailed satellite imagery to be shown on WED. It's free to use, and easy to set up (tutorials are available on the [Wedbing](https://wedbing.wordpress.com) website).
